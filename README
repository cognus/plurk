In this repo I include some customized scripts and
applications to plurk. 
#Apps:
---------------------------------------------------------
command-line-plurker (aka plurkEs.pl)
This is a Perl program
translated to Spanish. It is a  
customization of pkrumins (http://www.plurk.com/pkrumins)
program called "command-line-plurker".
Basic usage: 
plurkEs.pl Ya estoy \(hungry\)
plurkEs.pl -a shares http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcPvHkXfqoc \(Algo de The Clash para empezar\)
You should use the flag (?): plurkEs.pl ?
